📡 API Integration
This app uses the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch real-time weather data. Make sure to sign up and obtain your free API key, which you'll need to run the app locally.

🧪 How It Works
User types in a city name and submits the query.

The app makes an API call to OpenWeatherMap using the input.

Weather data is fetched and displayed dynamically in the UI, including:

Current temperature

Weather condition description (e.g., rain, clouds)

Icon representation of the current weather





# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.
